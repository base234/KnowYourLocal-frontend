# Pokemon Card Component Integration

This document describes the Pokemon card functionality that has been integrated into the chat system.

## Overview

The Pokemon card component automatically displays when a `get_pokemon_info` tool call is executed through the AI assistant. It provides a beautiful, interactive display of Pokemon information including stats, abilities, types, and sprites.

## Features

### Automatic Detection
- The system automatically detects when a Pokemon tool call is executed
- Pokemon cards are displayed inline with chat messages
- Regular text responses are shown normally when no tool calls occur

### Enhanced Pokemon Display
- **Visual Design**: Modern card layout with gradient backgrounds and shadows
- **Type Badges**: Color-coded type indicators (Electric, Fire, Water, etc.)
- **Stat Visualization**: Progress bars for each Pokemon stat with color coding
- **Responsive Layout**: Adapts to different screen sizes
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for missing data or broken images

### Data Fields Displayed
- Pokemon name and ID
- Height and weight
- Type(s) with color-coded badges
- Abilities
- Base stats with visual progress bars
- Official sprite image

## API Response Format

The component expects data in this format (from the `get_pokemon_info` tool call):

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Chat processed successfully",
  "data": {
    "ai_response": {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Here's information about Pikachu!",
      "refusal": null,
      "annotations": []
    },
    "tool_call_info": {
      "tool_call_executed": true,
      "function_name": "get_pokemon_info",
      "function_arguments": { "pokemon_name": "pikachu" },
      "tool_call_result": {
        "name": "pikachu",
        "id": 25,
        "height": 4,
        "weight": 60,
        "types": ["electric"],
        "abilities": ["static", "lightning-rod"],
        "stats": [
          {"name": "hp", "value": 35},
          {"name": "attack", "value": 55},
          {"name": "defense", "value": 40},
          {"name": "special-attack", "value": 50},
          {"name": "special-defense", "value": 50},
          {"name": "speed", "value": 90}
        ],
        "sprite": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/sprites/master/sprites/pokemon/25.png"
      },
      "final_response_after_tool_call": true
    }
  }
}
```

## Integration Points

### Chat Component (`src/pages/customer/Chat.jsx`)
- Automatically processes API responses with `tool_call_info`
- Displays Pokemon cards when `get_pokemon_info` tool calls are detected
- Shows tool call status with visual indicators
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing response formats

### Pokemon Card Component (`src/components/PokemonCard.jsx`)
- Renders Pokemon information in an attractive card format
- Handles missing or invalid data gracefully
- Provides fallback for broken sprite images
- Uses Tailwind CSS for responsive styling

## Usage Examples

### Testing the Component
1. **Test Pokemon Button**: Click the "Test Pokemon" button to see a sample Pokemon card
2. **Test New API Format**: Click the "Test New API Format" button to simulate the new API response
3. **Real API Calls**: Send messages like "Tell me about Pikachu" to trigger real tool calls

### Customization
- Modify `typeColors` object in `PokemonCard.jsx` to change type badge colors
- Adjust `statIcons` mapping to use different icons for stats
- Update the card styling by modifying Tailwind classes

## Error Handling

The component includes several error handling mechanisms:
- **Data Validation**: Checks for required fields before rendering
- **Image Fallbacks**: Shows placeholder when sprite images fail to load
- **Safe Data Access**: Handles missing or malformed data gracefully
- **Type Safety**: Validates arrays and objects before processing

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements could include:
- Animation effects for stat bars
- Interactive elements (click to expand details)
- Sound effects for Pokemon cries
- Evolution chain display
- Move list with power/accuracy
- Comparison between multiple Pokemon

## Dependencies

- React 18+
- Lucide React (for icons)
- Tailwind CSS (for styling)
- No additional Pokemon-specific libraries required

## Browser Support

- Modern browsers with ES6+ support
- Responsive design works on mobile and desktop
- Graceful degradation for older browsers
